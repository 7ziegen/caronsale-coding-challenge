# Backend Challenge

Welcome to the CarOnSale backend coding challenge.

In the /src directory, you find a typescript interface for a service that should:

TODO


Please fulfill the following tasks (according to the description above):

1. Install all Node.js dependencies for the project
2. Implement the interface in a class with method stubs (no functionality) 
3. Implement Mocha/Chai component tests in the ``/TODO/classes`` directory that test the desired behavior (Tests should be run when executing ``npm test``)
4. Register your service to the dependency injection container in ``main.ts``
5. Integrate your service into the application: If the application runs, the service should TODO, display the result and the exit with exit code 0. If the service is failing, the process should be quit with exit code -1.


Additional Hints:

 * You can run the application by running ``npm start``.
 * Please make sure, code quality is ensured (i.e. validating against the tslint file is not failing).
 * Please focus on correct and uniform formatting.
 * Be sure to use clear commit messages.
 * You can add as many (static) helper classes as you want.
 * You can install additional npm packages.
